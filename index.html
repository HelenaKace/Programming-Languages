              Konrad Zuse begins work on Plankalkül (Plan Calculus), the first algorithmic programming language, with
              the goal of creating the theoretical preconditions for the solution of general problems. Seven years
              earlier, Zuse had developed and built the world´s first binary digital computer, the Z1. He completed the
              first fully functional program-controlled electromechanical digital computer, the Z3, in 1941. Only the Z4
              — the most sophisticated of his creations — survived World War II.

              in the “pseudopod” scene in the movie The Abyss. When Adobe saw potential in the project they bought a

            <h1>Scratch is publicly released</h1>
            <p>Scratch is released to the public. A free programming language that focused on education, it was designed
              by a team led by Mitchel Resnick at the MIT Media Lab Lifelong Kindergarten Group. Intended to be used by
              educators, students and parents as a teaching language, it had a number of applications in educational
              settings. These included math, computer science, language arts and social studies. Its interface allowed
              novice users to stack and organize block commands to write programs. Scratch has millions of users
              worldwide and is available in more than 40 languages.

            <h1>HTML 5 is Announced</h1>
            <p>HTML 5 is announced as the successor to HTML 4, which had become the standard for web markup languages in
              1997. Markup languages describe how web pages will look and function. Work on HTML 5 had begun in 2004
              under the auspices of the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. It was simplified compared
              to its predecessors and was intended to be human-readable. HLTML 5 also offered a number of improvements
              for multimedia, such as simplifying the embedding of content such as streaming video and games into web
              pages.
